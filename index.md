Hi, I’m Joey. This project is my small contribution to Christian systematic theology. I’m endeavoring to bring “the total weight of the teaching of Scripture”<ref>Grudem, Wayne (2009). ''Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine'' (p. 28). Zondervan.</ref> to bear on many important topics here. For more on how and why the site came to be, read [[Project:About|about this project]].

You’re welcome to browse my [[Project:Featured topics|favorite topics]] or all topics [[Special:AlphabeticalIndex|alphabetically]] or [[:c:Top level|categorically]], or use the search box if you’re looking for something specific. You can even visit a [[Special:Random|random topic]] if you’re feeling lucky.

If anything here either helps you or is clearly incorrect or unhelpful, you’re welcome to send feedback via [http://twitter.com/joeyday Twitter] or [http://facebook.com/joeynday Facebook].
